# Glimpse
Cost evaluation for Glimpse, a primitive for cross-chain event verification. 

We evaluate the gas costs considering Bitcoin as the source blockchain and Ethereum as the destination blockchain.

This project uses [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#overview), a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your Ethereum software.
